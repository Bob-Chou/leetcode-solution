Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

Return true if there exists i, j, k 
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.

Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.


Example 1:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true



Example 2:


Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
