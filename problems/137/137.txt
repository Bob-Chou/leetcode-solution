Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:


Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
