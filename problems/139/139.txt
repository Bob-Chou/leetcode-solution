Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:


	The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
	You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.


Example 1:


Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".


Example 2:


Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Â             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.


Example 3:


Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
