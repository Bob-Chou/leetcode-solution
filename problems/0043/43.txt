Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:


Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Example 2:


Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"


Note:


	The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
	Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
	Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
	You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
